This a digital catalog on and off the block chain with different Auth mechanism.
Fashlogue which has a user and designer model, its value proposition is relating users with designers in an interactive manner. It focuses on displaying post and catalogue of each designer, in turn get reviews from users. Reviews such as ratings, likes, comments.

This is the base API for the Fashlogue. It comes configured with the following tools:

## NPM / Yarn scripts

The following scripts are provided to build, test etc:

- `dev` watch compillation of ts code
- `build-ts` builds your site for use in a development environment and outputs it to `dist`
- `quick-build` builds your site for deployment to a production environment

## Linting

We work with TSLint.
It is one of the most widely used styleguides by the JS community and offers pretty strict linting too!
Running lint scripts

- `lint` show lint errors on code.

## Testing

Tests are written with Mocha as the test runner and chai for assertion, test are picked up anywhere in the `src/test` directory if they include `.test` (e.g. `user.test.ts`).
